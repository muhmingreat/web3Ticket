            A Brief History of Our Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4  " >
            The idea for our platform came about when we realized that traditional ticketing
            systems had many limitations, including fraud, scalping, and lack of transparency. 
            In 2021, we started exploring blockchain technology as a way to eliminate these 
            problems. The decentralized nature of Web3 allowed us to create an immutable, 
            tamper-proof record of every ticket, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud.
